## Week 1

### HTML

HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is a common markup language used to create online pages and web applications.

To instruct the browser on how to format material, use tags.

tags include < p >, < head >, < body >, < ul >, < ol >

< p > is used to label a section as a paragraph

< head > is used to store mainly the title and scripts required for the browser like the CSS link

< body > is used to store main bulk of code

< img > is used to display an image

#### Lists

There are 2 types of lists ul, ol

UL is known as unordered list. Using it will make the list show up as bullet points

OL is known as an ordered list. Using it will make the list show up with nuumbered points

### CSS

Cascading Style Sheets also known as CSS, is a language used to specify the appearance of an HTML element when shown in a browser.

This ranges from background colors to test fonts and sizes.

## Week 2

### Semantic Web

There is no intrinsic meaning in the div element by itself. It serves only as a container, and more specific semantic options are frequently available.

Semantics relates to syntax

Semantics is the meaning behing words, phrases. In this case, it is HTML

Common elements in semantic include < nav >, < artle >, < section >, < table >. < form > and < aside >

< aside > is used for information that is only loosely related to the primary information. frequently found in call out boxes or sidebars

< nav > is typically used to place the menu links. This only applies to the site's most important navigational features, not to all of its links.

### CSS

CSS is able top edit the color, size and position of items in the browser

#### CSS Rule

selector{ property: value;}

Example of this rule is p{color: red;}

### ID

ID attribute can be used to target specific parts of the elements

## Week 3

We learnt about form, input and label tags as well as writing some simple validations

### Form

Unfortunately, until backend ilanguages is learnt, forms are usually quite "sad" if not useless

It is filled with input tags

### Input

Interactive controls are produced using input tags. The input type is determined by the "Type" attribute.

### Label

It is used to give the form components captions. For creating sites that are accessible, it is crucial.

### Validations

It is verified that an input is not empty via the needed attribute. Type validations are another thing.

when input type = Email is used, it requires the inputted text to include an '@' sign to be able to be used as a valid input

### Wireframes

Wireframes can help establish important functions, indicate content structure, and quickly develop concepts.

## Week 4

### Responsive Images

Responsive Images are crucial because they automatically adapt to fit the size of the screen, load higher resolution images only when necessary for better performance, and offer more design customization depending on the device.

### Github

We learnt how to set up GitHub repository as well

## Week 6

### Javascript basics

A named container holding a value is known as a variable.

Any sensible name can be used as the variable's name, but each variable must have a distinct name.

There are 3 types of primitive data: Booleans, Strings, and Numbers

Numbers: Decimals, integers, and floating point numbers (No quotes)

Strings: Text and character sequences (Enclosed in either single or double quotes)

Booleans: rational data (True or False)

### Comparison

= = = means strict equal to

! = = means strict not equal to

= = means is equal to

! = means is not equal to

> means greater than

> < means lesser than

> = means greater than or equal to

> < = means lesser than or equal to

### Logical operator

& & means that the operator test more than one condtion (The expression yields true if both expressions evaluate to true. The expression is false if even one of these returns false.)

| | means logtical or (The expression yields true if both expressions evaluate to true. The expression is false if even one of these returns false.)

! means not. This operator inverts true or false values
